# ⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline with Kubernetes

A **DevOps project** demonstrating a complete **CI/CD pipeline** for backend microservices. The pipeline automates **testing, building, and deployment** of **Python** and **Java microservices** using **GitHub Actions** and **Jenkins**, with **Docker** and **Kubernetes** for containerized deployment. **Prometheus** and **Grafana** provide monitoring and observability for reliability.

---

## 🚀 Features

* 🔄 **Automated CI/CD** with GitHub Actions & Jenkins
* 🐳 **Containerization** using Docker
* ☸️ **Kubernetes Deployment** for scalability & zero-downtime updates
* 🐍 **Python Microservice** + ☕ **Java Microservice** support
* 📈 **Monitoring & Alerting** with Prometheus & Grafana
* 🔧 **Infrastructure-as-Code Ready** for cloud-native environments

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions, Jenkins
* **Containerization:** Docker
* **Orchestration:** Kubernetes
* **Services:** Python (FastAPI), Java (Spring Boot)
* **Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana

## ⚡ Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ci-cd-k8s-pipeline.git
cd ci-cd-k8s-pipeline
```

### 2️⃣ Run Services with Docker (Optional Local Test)

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### 3️⃣ Setup Jenkins

* Install **Jenkins** with required plugins (Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub)
* Configure pipeline from `jenkins/Jenkinsfile`

### 4️⃣ Deploy to Kubernetes

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/service.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/ingress.yaml
```

## 📡 CI/CD Pipeline Overview

1. **GitHub Actions** triggers on pull request or commit

   * Runs unit tests for Python & Java services
   * Builds Docker images and pushes to container registry

2. **Jenkins Pipeline**

   * Deploys new images to Kubernetes
   * Performs rolling updates (zero-downtime)

3. **Kubernetes**

   * Orchestrates microservices
   * Scales automatically

4. **Monitoring**

   * Prometheus scrapes metrics
   * Grafana visualizes system performance

---

## 📊 Monitoring Example

* Prometheus: `http://localhost:9090`
* Grafana: `http://localhost:3000`

  * Pre-built dashboards for CPU, memory, request latency

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* [ ] Add Helm charts for Kubernetes deployments
* [ ] Implement Canary or Blue-Green deployments
* [ ] Integrate security scans (Snyk/Trivy) into pipeline
* [ ] Set up centralized logging with ELK stack
